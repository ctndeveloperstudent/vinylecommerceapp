# T3A3-A Assignment: Vinyl eCommerce Platform (MERN)

This repository is the complete documentation for the design and plannning of my MERN stack application: an ecommerce platform built for a vinyl music store. It is built according to the rubric requirements of assignment T3A3-A from Coder Academy.

## R1: Overview (Description of the website including purpose, functionality, target audience and tech stack)

### Description
My website is an eCommerce platform designed specifically for vinyl record enthusiasts, providing a modern, user friendly shopping experience where customers can browse and purchase vinyl records with ease. It features a dark theme, that highlights album covers while ensuring a sleek and intuitive design.

The website's structure is also adaptable for other business owners or artists who want to sell different types of products, making it a versitile eCommerce solution beyond just vinyl records.

### Purpose
This website was created because many vinyl eCommerce platforms lack modern UI/UX, have outdated search features, or provide a poor shopping experience. My goal is to offer a sleek, well-organised marketplace for vinyl lovers while making it easy for independent sellers and artists to list and sell their records.

For business owners looking to sell other types of products, this website can be customised to fit different industries, offering a scalable and user-friendly ecommerce solution.
